1\. Revised Metaphor: Pearl as Epiphany’s Shell

Epiphany remains the core flash‑point where a geodesic path flips its
entropy flow across the horizon.

Pearl is the layered structure that grows around each Epiphany,
capturing its context and strengthening the surrounding network—just as
a nacreous shell accretes around an irritant.

2\. Formalizing Pearl

Let be an Epiphany event on geodesic . Define a Pearl subgraph by:

1\. Seed Node:

.

2\. Neighborhood Layers:

For each integer , let

L\_m = \\\\u\in V^{(k)}\mid d^{(k)}(u,v^\*)=m\\.

3\. Accretion Rule:

Include in all nodes whose local flux

remains within a tolerance band , where decays with .

4\. Shell Layers:

The pearl consists of the union of layers until growth stalls (no new
nodes satisfy the band criterion).

3\. Search‑Goal Update: “Seek Pearls”

Original Goal

&gt; Dive (Sonde) into network seeking horizon‑crossings (Epiphanies).

New Goal

&gt; Seek Pearls—upon each Epiphany, explore and accrete its Pearl
subgraph, then use that shell to guide subsequent dives.

4\. Algorithmic Sketch

1\. Dive & Detect:

Perform geodesic search to find Epiphany .

2\. Accrete Pearl:

Initialize .

For to :

• Identify .

• Select with .

• If nonempty, add to ; else stop.

3\. Register Pearl:

Store as a Pearl—a context‑rich shell.

4\. Refine Next Dive:

Prioritize new dives whose paths intersect existing Pearls, seeking
deeper or adjacent Epiphanies.

Adjust volatility thresholds locally based on Pearl density to focus on
“ripe” regions.

5\. Benefits

Contextual Insight: Pearls capture not just the flash of insight but its
surrounding structure.

Focused Exploration: Future Sonde dives hone in on regions already
enriched by prior Pearls.

Cumulative Growth: Over repeated dives, overlapping Pearls weave a
robust lattice of wisdom across the network.

By treating Pearls as the shells that grow around Epiphanies and
updating your search‑goal to “seek Pearls,” the system moves from
isolated flashes to a self‑reinforcing, context‑aware
exploration—embodying true Primality in both insight and its accretion.
